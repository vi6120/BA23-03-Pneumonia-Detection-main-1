\chapter{Python Package}

\section{Flask}

Python has a simple and adaptable web framework called Flask. It is intended to simplify and scale up web development. Web developers may create web applications more quickly with Flask, which adheres to the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and is renowned for its simplicity and minimalism. \cite{flaskdocs:2021}

\subsection{Description}

Flask offers crucial functions and resources for managing the creation of web applications. You may use it to manage sessions, handle form data, construct routes, handle HTTP requests and answers, and more. Additionally, Flask offers a number of plugins and extensions that improve its capability for tasks like API development, user authentication, and database integration. 

\subsection{Installation}
To install the Flask module in PyCharm, you need to follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open PyCharm and create a new Python project or open an existing one.
	\item Once your project is open, go to the "File" menu and select "Settings" (or "Preferences" on macOS).
	\item In the settings window, expand the "Project" section and select "Project Interpreter."
	\item On the right side of the settings window, you'll see a gear icon. Click on it and select "Add..."
	\item In the "Add Python Interpreter" window, you'll see a search bar. Type "flask" into the search bar to find the Flask package.
	\item Once Flask appears in the list of available packages, select it and click on the "Install Package" button at the bottom right corner.
	\item PyCharm will download and install Flask for your project. You can monitor the progress in the "Event Log" tab at the bottom of the window.
	\item After the installation is complete, you can close the settings window.
\end{enumerate}

Alternatively, you can use pip, the package manager for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
	pip install flask
\end{verbatim}
This will download and install the Flask package and its dependencies.

\subsection{Manual}
To access the Flask module and the example, follow the below step-by-step instructions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Launch PyCharm and create a new project by selecting "Create New Project" from the welcome screen or navigating to "File" > "New Project" from the menu.
	\item Choose a project location and select the Python interpreter that has Flask installed. If the interpreter is not pre-configured, you can click on the gear icon and add a new interpreter or choose an existing one.
	\item Once the project is created, right-click on the project name in the Project Explorer on the left side of the PyCharm window and select "New" > "Python File" to create a new Python file.
	\item Name the file \texttt{app.py} and click "OK".
	\item Open the \texttt{app.py} file and enter the code. We have provided the code in the example.
	\item Save the file by pressing \texttt{Ctrl + S} or going to "File" > "Save".
	\item Make sure that the Flask module is installed in the Python environment configured for the project. If it is not installed, open the terminal within PyCharm by selecting "View" > "Tool Windows" > "Terminal". Then run the following command: 
\begin{verbatim}
	pip install flask
\end{verbatim}
	\item After installing Flask, go back to the \texttt{app.py} file and click on the green arrow next to the \texttt{if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_':} line. This will run the \texttt{app.py} file.
	\item Flask will start a local development server, and you should see an output similar to Figure 7.1.

		\end{tikzpicture}
		\caption{\textbf{Flask server}}
		\footnotesize \textbf{Reference:Author}
		\label{fig:Flask server}
	\end{figure}
	\item Open a web browser and enter the following URL: \texttt{http://127.0.0.1:5000/} or \texttt{http://localhost:5000/}. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the browser.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Example}

Listing 7.1 shows example for  "Hello, World!" using Flask.

\section{TensorFlow}

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a flexible and efficient way to build and deploy machine learning models. TensorFlow supports various platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, and offers high-level APIs for easy model development and low-level APIs for advanced customization.

\subsection{Description}


Machine learning development can take advantage of a variety of features and tools provided by TensorFlow. It offers an abstraction of a computational graph where actions are represented as nodes and data flows as edges. Machine learning models can be executed and optimized effectively using this graph-based method.

\vspace{8pt}	
For activities like mathematical computations, data preprocessing, model training, and inference, TensorFlow contains a sizable library of operations and functions that are already built in. It provides tools for model visualization and debugging and supports well-known deep learning architectures including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

\vspace{8pt}
Additionally, TensorFlow offers a high-level API called Keras that streamlines the creation of neural networks. Developers can quickly experiment and iterate on their models using Keras' user-friendly interface and abstraction of numerous intricacies. 

\subsection{Installation}

To install TensorFlow, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. TensorFlow is compatible with Python versions 3.5 to 3.9.
	\item Open a terminal or command prompt.
	\item Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) by running the following command:
	\begin{verbatim}
		python -m venv myenv
	\end{verbatim}
	Replace "myenv" with the desired name of your virtual environment.
	\item Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:
	\begin{verbatim}
		# For Windows
		myenv\Scripts\activate
		
		# For macOS and Linux
		source myenv/bin/activate
	\end{verbatim}
	\item Once the virtual environment is activated, run the following command to install TensorFlow:
	\begin{verbatim}
		pip install tensorflow
	\end{verbatim}
	This command installs the CPU version of TensorFlow. If you have a compatible GPU and want to utilize it for accelerated computations, you can install the GPU version by following the instructions provided in the TensorFlow documentation.
\end{enumerate}

	\item Create a new Python file or open an existing one.
	\item Import TensorFlow into your Python script:
	\begin{verbatim}
		import tensorflow as tf
	\end{verbatim}
	\item You can now use TensorFlow to build and train machine learning models. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example}
	
The example assumes that the training and test datasets (x\_train, y\_train, x\_test, y\_test) and new data (x\_new) for prediction. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
